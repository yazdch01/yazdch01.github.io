  <h2> The goal of making this website </h2>
  <p></a>The website <strong> Official website of Ali Yazdani</strong> has been created for a practical course of computer science at <i>Luther College</i> In this website we have tried to use different types of html tags to make sure that we have learned them properl</p>
  <b> list of some tags we have learned until now</b> 
  <ol> <li><i>  em</i></li></ol> 
    <p> This makes your text to be written in an <i> Italic font</i>. Morevoer, if you want to make and emphasises in your text you can use this symbol or either the symbol <i> i</i> </p> 
    <li> The tag <b>strong</b></li> 
    <p> This tag makes you able to <b>BOLD</b> some specific texts when you are writing on your website. Moreover you can you the tag <i>b</b> also to bold your text.</i></p>

    <h3> The CSS tags</h3>
    <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. which is a language to design our website. For example the colors and features of our website can be designed through this language. 
      <b> Selectors</b> is a term which we use to select a specific element  or part of our website to be styled and designed. After selecting a particular part of the website we need to follow the rule to be able to make our
      the change we are aiming for. This change will be happened through a rule which has a <b> property</b> and <b>value</b>. So he example belowe shows a simple use of CSS. 
    </p>
    <p><html> <head> <title> Practice of CSS</title> <b> <style> h1 { Property:Value; }</style></b></B></b></head></html></p>. 
    <b> Colors: </b> In CSS we can change the colors of different elements through 3 different ways: 
    <ol> <li> Names</li> <li> RGB </li> <li> HEX codes</li></ol>
    <ul> <li> <b> Names:</b></li> We can write down names of different colors and make our style, however, sometimes there are colors that we don't know the names of them therefore 
      we are using different methods which make us to use many mixed colors to design our elements. 
      <li> <strong>RGB:</strong>  </li>which stands for RED, GREEN, BLUE. These three colors are the main colors in natural world which with the combination of them we can a variety of colors. To use this method in our website what we do is that we write rgb(123456) after our selector. 
      Each two number shows the solidity of each color and results different colors. 
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <b><h4>Styles:</h4></b> 
    Styles is the main elemente which we need to design a specific element in our website. We need a starter and finisher for our work 
    to make a style we have to select an element and then apply the changes. 
    
    <b> Class and ID </b>
    <p> Class and ID are the ways we can make a specific style of change and apply it to some particular elements. For example we can make a class 
      changing the color of a text to blue and changing the background of it as yellow with a 20px width. 
    </p>
    <p> <h1 class= "classstyle"> Hello People, how are you doing? </h1></p>
    
    <b> ID:</b>
    <p> The difference between ID and Class is that we can use ID for only one element, however, we can use the class for different elements in different places</p>
